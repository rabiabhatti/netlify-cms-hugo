  <h3>About</h3>
  <p>My name is Chase Ohlson. I'm a frontend software engineer & freelance web developer in Los Angeles -- with roots in
    digital marketing & SEO. I'm passionate about music, technology and basically everything that makes the internet
    tick.</p>
  <p>My work currently consists of a full time engineering role at The Noun Project (working on Lingo) & managing
    ongoing freelance clients and side projects. I find this balancing act to be super resourceful in terms my learning
    as a web developer, as well as for keeping up with the rapid expansion of developer tools, libraries, frameworks,
    etc.</p>
  <p>My freelance web development roots are in Wordpress & Shopify, of which I'm self taught. In 2017, I started at UCLA
    to broaden my knowledge of the Node.js ecosystem. Since then, I fell in love with & have been primarily using React
    & Redux in web applications. For static sites, I love using Gatsby for creating blazing fast, SEO-driven headless
    frontend user interfaces.</p>
  <p>Whether you're a business owner looking to get started on a app or web development project with a freelance web
    developer, a developer looking to collaborate on something cool, or just wanting to say hi, shoot me a message and
    let's work together.</p>
